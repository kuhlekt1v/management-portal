*Initial thoughts and notes detailing the development of a full-stack manufacturing management portal.*

## Core Technologies

* **Front-End:** React.JS (Version 17.0.2)
* **Back-End:** .NET Core 5.0
* **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server

## Overview

The portal will be built in a series of phases ultimately forming a suite of tools. The management suite is designed to assist in the planning and management of the overall manufacturing lifecycle. The portal will be used by employees at all levels of the organization from machine operators to supervisors and upper management. The system is required to be user-friendly in order to prevent disruptions to ongoing manufacturing processes to the greatest extent possible. The system must also be flexible and scalable to meet the fluid demands of dynamic manufacturing operations.
